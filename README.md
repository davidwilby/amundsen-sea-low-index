The Amundsen Seas Low (ASL) is a highly dynamic and mobile climatological low pressure system located in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. In this sector, variability in sea-level pressure is greater than anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, making it challenging to isolate local fluctuations in the ASL from larger-scale shifts in atmospheric pressure. The position and strength of the ASL are crucial for understanding regional change over West Antarctica. 

This repository contains a python package (`asli`) which implements the ASL calculation methods described in [Hosking *et al.* (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067143), as well as notebooks illustrating its usage.
