Column Labels:
  time       = YYYY-MM-01 (monthly data)
  SectorPres = Area-average sea level pressure over sector (170-298 E : 60-80 S)
  ActCenPres = Actual central pressure of ASL
  lon        = Longitudinal location of ASL (degrees East)
  lat        = Latitudinal location of ASL
  RelCenPres = Relative central pressure (ActCenPres 'minus' SectorPres)

The ASL (low pressure system) detection algorithm may be improved over time. Therefore 
it is recommended that the version number below is noted when using these data.
  ASLi_version_id = 3.XXXX
